# The Space Situational Awareness Domain Ontology (SSAO)
The SSAO is an ontology of the space situational awareness (SSA) domain. The domain includes objects in the space environment, which includes orbital and near-Earth space. It focuses on the relationships between objects near Earth (or any planetary reference frame). It involves observation, detection, identificaiton, tracking and propogation (predition of future behavior or motion) of objects in space. The central focus is awareness of the space environment surrounding Earth to ensure safety and security of Earth and space-borne assetts (satellites, etc.)

* PhD or MS fellowship, or 
* a employment or job

CONTEXT: This has been a pursuit since 2011, when I conceived the concept (see my orbital debris ontology repository) (Documentation, including references, verifying this five-year ideation is available upon request). Since then I've been seeking a sustainable opportunity (employment, PhD post, research position, etc.) to work on, develop, and implement this with others. I have developed a number of papers on this to make it a Phd project. Interested potential co-authors are welcome to contact me.
