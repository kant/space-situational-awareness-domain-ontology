# The Space Situational Awareness Ontology
The Space Situational Awareness Ontology (SSAO) is an ontology of the SSA domain, which includes the orbital, near-Earth and deep space environments. The domain involves observation, detection, identificaiton, tracking and propogation(predition of future behavior or motion) of objects in space (particularly in orbit).

##Status##
Seeking opportunity to develop this project. Seeking funding, partners, PhD position or a job to realize the concept.
CONTEXT: This has been a pursuit since 2011, when I conceived the concept (documentation, including references, verifying this available upon request). Since then I've been seeking a sustainable opportunity (employment, PhD fellowship, research position, etc.) to work on, develop, and implement this. I have conceptualized and developed enough paper ideas on this to make it a Phd project.
