# The Space Situational Awareness Domain Ontology (SSAO)
The SSAO is an ontology of the space situational awareness (SSA) domain [1]. The SSAO domain minimally includes observation, detection, identificaiton, tracking and propogation (predition of future behavior or motion) of objects in orbit. The SSAO domain, then, includes at least that which affords awareness of the space environment. The overall (broader) domain--called the Orbital Space Environment Domain (OSEDO)in more recent publications[3][4]--includes the space environment (orbital and near-Earth space) and objects therein. NOTE: as such, domain delmiting, as well as the name, scope and relation of the SSAO to other related ontologies (see [5]) by the author is subject to revision pending further research.  

The central application focus is awareness of orbital space surrounding Earth, toward ensuring safety and security of Earth and space-borne assetts (satellites, etc.). However, give the upper-level (more general/abstract) classifcation goal, the SSAO can be generalized to any central body. SSAO aims to formally and computationally represent the relationships between objects near Earth (or any planetary reference frame), and annotate orbital and other SSA instance data to facilitate data-sharing and integration among

##Status##
The ontology is currently in preliminary conceptual stages of development, no claims to completeness are made, and the both the ontology and its name are subject to revision.
Lack of development is due to lack of funded opportuninty to sustainably work on it.

SEEKING OPPORTUNITIES to sustainably development on this ontology, such as...
* funding, applying to grants with professors in relevant/related disciplines 
* cooperative partnernships, interdisciplinary team, co-workers, advisors
* PhD or MS fellowship, where this or the overall project concept can serve as a degree thesis/project 
* a related employment or contract position; or a research assistant/associate position
...to realize the concept

CONTEXT-EFFORTS: This has been a pursuit since 2011, when I conceived the concept (see [2], and repositories in [5]) (Documentation, including references, verifying this five-year ideation is available upon request).  Since then I've been searching for a funded opportunity (employment, PhD fellowship, research position, researcher-training network, mentors, etc.) to sustainably work on, develop, and implement this ontology in a team environment with professionals in astrodynamics, astroinformatics, computer science, and ontology engineering. I have developed enough paper cocepts on this to make it a Phd project.

Professors interested in applying to grants with me should contact my email below. Persons interested in potential co-authors should also contact me.

##Note##
Given the domain, synonymous names include: 'space domain ontology' (SDO), and 'space object object' (SOO). As I've conceived it, thus far, SDO is most general, followed by SSAO, and then SOO. Further development required on these considerations.
