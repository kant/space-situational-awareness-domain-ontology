# The Space Situational Awareness Domain Ontology (SSAO)
(NOTE: The ssao ontology file and other content of this repository is being moved to https://github.com/rrovetto/Orbital-Space-Ontology-Project for a more unified struture. This repository will remain onsite for the timebeing.)

The SSA ontology is an ontology of the space situational awareness (SSA) domain [2]. It provides a defined terminology for SSA concepts and objects. The scope of SSAO, and its domain, minimally includes that which affords awareness and knowledge of the orbital and near-Earth space environment. This consists of observation, detection, identification, tracking, re-identification, and propagation (prediction of future behavior/motion) activities of objects in orbit. 

In addition to these SSA activities, observations & measurements, and events in orbit & the orbital objects themselves must be ontologically represented. The relationships between these entities are also critical to fully capture the overall orbital space environment domain[3][4]. Ontology terms for these entities may constitute sub-domain space ontologies--such as the orbital debris ontology, the orbital event ontology, and so forth, each of which can be imported into the SSAO. Alternatively, such terms can be terms directly part of the SSAO. These ontology architectures are under consideration.

The overall project (http://purl.org/space-ontology) is to apply ontology to orbital data in order to foster data-sharing, integration among orbital debris, space object and other SSA databases; automated reasoning, knowledge discovery and semantic and systems interoperability.

The focus is awareness of orbital space surrounding Earth, toward ensuring safety and security of Earth and space-borne assetts (satellites, etc.). However, give the upper-level (more general/abstract) classification goal, the SSAO can be generalized to any central body. SSAO aims to formally and computationally represent the relationships between objects near Earth (or any planetary reference frame), and annotate orbital and other SSA instance data to facilitate data-sharing and integration among

##Note##
Given the domain, synonymous names include: 'space domain ontology' (SDO), and 'space object object' (SOO). As I've conceived it, thus far, SDO is most general, followed by SSAO, and then SOO. Further development required on these considerations.
